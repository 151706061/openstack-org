  * LINK: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/telco_orchestration
    (sgordon_, 14:41:16)
  * (ijw) I think you'd need to make clear what orchestration would be
    an Openstack *service* and what would be better implemented as an
    Openstack *application* - what you've described there could be an
    application but pretty much all Openstack projects today are
    integrated services.  (sgordon_, 14:41:29)
  * need to rewrite to make clearer what's OpenStack "service" versus
    "application"  (sgordon_, 14:45:03)
  * further edits to be done in etherpad, once consensus is reached move
    to wiki  (sgordon_, 14:46:11)
