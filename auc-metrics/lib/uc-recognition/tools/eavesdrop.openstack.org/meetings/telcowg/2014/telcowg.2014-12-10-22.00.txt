    (sgordon_, 22:03:03)
  * cloudon comments "would be good to understand the locality criteria
    a bit more" w.r.t. vpn instantiation use case  (sgordon_, 22:05:24)
  * potentially wider applicability for concepts such as "network
    nearness"  (sgordon_, 22:05:55)

    concept), VNF instantiation and seperation of Infra/App
    Orchestration  (sgordon_, 22:08:42)
  * ACTION: rprakash adding Mobile Network use case for GTP tunneling
    and will bring it next week  (sgordon_, 22:09:08)

* orchestration  (sgordon_, 22:11:54)

* Requirement Definition  (sgordon_, 22:14:27)
  * aveiga suggests picking one use case per week for review, add an
    etherpad link for it in the wiki and use the week to go over gaps,
    what's planned, what's not, define success criteria  (sgordon_,
    22:19:17)
  * need a way to make sure original use case submitter is involved in

    (sgordon_, 22:31:12)
  * some concerns about suggestion of removing the linux bridge from the
    network path in ML2 port security spec proposal comments  (sgordon_,
    22:34:19)
  * cloudon notes: 1) "if pps through the network stack is the concern,
    agree removing the linux bridge helps, but still won't get you to
    anything ike the perf of a DPDK-accel vswitch" 2) "also statement
    that service VMs won't need security support is... debatable"
    (sgordon_, 22:34:38)
  * concern about balance of optimization versus effectively removing a
    feature  (sgordon_, 22:35:02)
  * may be better suited to an additional bug or feature request against
    final implementation  (sgordon_, 22:37:24)

* other discussion  (sgordon_, 22:37:28)

* OPNFV and OpenStack overlap/divergence?  (sgordon_, 22:38:34)
  * "From jaypipes: Why does there seem to be completely parallel and
    duplicative efforts and conversations going on in the OPNFV mailing
    lists and sites? What is going to be done to bring alignment between
    folks from OpenStack and folks from OPNFV working towards common
    goals?"  (sgordon_, 22:38:44)
