  * steveg was to send out a brief survey monkey to the list and we

* virtual IMS use case discussion  (sgordon, 14:08:50)
  * LINK:
    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TelcoWorkingGroup/UseCases#Virtual_IMS_Core
    (sgordon, 14:08:55)
  * implemented as a series of N+k compute pools; meeting a given SLA
    requires being able to limit the impact of a single host failure
    (sgordon, 14:13:36)
  * potentially a scheduler gap here: affinity/anti-affinity can be
    expressed pair-wise between VMs, which is sufficient for a 1:1
    active/passive architecture, but an N+k pool needs a concept
    equivalent to "group anti-affinity" i.e. allowing the NFV
    orchestrator to assign each VM in a pool to one of X buckets, and
    requesting OpenStack to ensure no single host failure can affect
    more than one bucket  (sgordon, 14:13:43)
  * Require a reference HA design for OpenStack services for critical
    NFV such as vIMS  (sgordon, 14:19:38)

    (sgordon, 14:32:23)
  * ACTION: mkoderer to take a stab at documenting use for multi-site
    (sgordon, 14:33:57)
  * possible commonalities around HA and multi-site requirements to
    identify as we progress through use cases  (sgordon, 14:53:12)
  * need more flexibility from Availability Zone and Host Aggregate
    placement, along with more flexible placement rules for the
    scheduler  (sgordon, 14:54:00)
  * general agreement to focus on use cases in the context of single
    site deployment first  (sgordon, 14:55:28)
  * Is gerrit a better mechanism for use case review?  (sgordon,
    14:56:01)
