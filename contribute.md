## How to contribute

We ask that all contributors sign the OpenStack CLA, consistent with how we manage other OpenStack projects: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute#Contributor_License_Agreement . Please note that this process is based on the Apache Software Foundation model, and the CLA does NOT require copyright assignment.

In the future we will integrate with the OpenStack Gerrit system for managing reviews. Once that is rolled out, the CLA signature check will be automated to prevent unauthorized pull requests. In the interim, we will verify contributors manually based on the email address associated with their Gerrit account. If your email address in Gerrit is different than the one you use for Github, please note that in the pull request.
